**This page serves as a summary of the personal experiences I've had to date, outside of professional work experience.**

## Personal Projects
### Australian Weather Analytics
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau)

This is a personal project aimed to improve my familiarity with visualisation tools, more specifically PowerBI. A dataset was drawn from Kaggle and imported into PowerBI for visualisation. Goals were created in order to obtain different statistical measures that might prove interesting, and to challenge my ability to build dashboards. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau) along with notes detailing the analysis, limitations and reflections.

### Titanic ML Competition (Kaggle) (In Progress)
[GitHub] [Kaggle]

The famous (or infamous depending on how you look at it) Titanic ML project. I intended to use the project as a means of introducing myself to Kaggle and the Python language. I understand that as far as projects go, this is not the most complex or comprehensive. To take the project further and develop on my other skills, I conducted the same exercise of predicting the Titanic casualties through PowerBI in addition to the Notebook found on Kaggle.
