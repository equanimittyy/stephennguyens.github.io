**This page serves as a summary of the personal experiences I've had to date, outside of professional work experience.**

## Personal Projects
### Australian Weather Analytics
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau)

This was a personal project aimed to improve my familiarity with visualisation tools, more specifically PowerBI. A dataset was drawn from Kaggle and imported into PowerBI for visualisation. Goals were created in order to obtain different statistical measures that might prove interesting, and to challenge my ability to build dashboards. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau) along with notes detailing the analysis, limitations and reflections.

### Moby Dick (In Progress)
[GitHub]

This was a project aimed to improve my Python skills and commit to an end-to-end project that involved the collection of data, data quality assessment and correction, analysis, and visualisation. I used Python and BeautifulSoup to write scripts that firstly exported a website in HTML to local (to prevent repeated requests to a live website) and then used Python to extract data. This data was analysed to provide specific information such as Title, Author etc.

### Titanic ML Competition (Kaggle)
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stephennguyens/titanic-ml-competition-sn)

The famous (or infamous depending on how you look at it) Titanic ML project. I intended to use the project as a means of introducing myself to Kaggle and the Python language. Upon completion of the pubicly available tutorial and the project, it was clear that the experience served as more of an introduction to the use of Kaggle. Little to no Python knowledge was required to complete the project. From here, I identified that, in order to progress my Python knowledge, it would be wise to undertake Kaggle competitions with the help of other resources such as books and research papers to identify different ML statistical techniques that may be applied.
