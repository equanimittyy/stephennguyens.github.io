**This page serves as a summary of the personal experiences I've had to date, outside of professional work experience.**

## Personal Projects
### Moby Dick
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/mobydick)

This was an exercise aimed to improve my Python skills and commit to an ETL/ELT project that involved the collection of data, data cleaning and a bit of visualisations.
I used Python and the BeautifulSoup library to scrape an online website, then used Python to transform data into a usable format. Data was processed and loaded into PowerBI to provide a breakdown of what the most frequent words used per chapter were etc.

### Australian Weather Analytics
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau)

This was a personal project aimed to improve my familiarity with visualisation tools, more specifically PowerBI. A dataset was drawn from Kaggle and imported into PowerBI for visualisation. Goals were created in order to obtain different statistical measures that might prove interesting, and to challenge my ability to build dashboards. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau) along with notes detailing the analysis, limitations and reflections.
