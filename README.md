**This page serves as a summary of the personal experiences I've had to date, outside of professional work experience.**

## Personal Projects
### Moby Dick
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/mobydick)

This was a project aimed to improve my Python skills and commit to an ETL/ELT project that involved the collection of data, data quality assessment and cleaning and loading into visualisation. I used Python and BeautifulSoup to write scripts that firstly exported a website in HTML to local (to prevent repeated requests to a live website) and then used Python to extract data into a usable format. This data was processed and loaded to provide a breakdown of what the most frequent words used per chapter were etc.

### Australian Weather Analytics
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau)

This was a personal project aimed to improve my familiarity with visualisation tools, more specifically PowerBI. A dataset was drawn from Kaggle and imported into PowerBI for visualisation. Goals were created in order to obtain different statistical measures that might prove interesting, and to challenge my ability to build dashboards. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau) along with notes detailing the analysis, limitations and reflections.
