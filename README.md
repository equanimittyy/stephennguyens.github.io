**This page serves as a list of the personal experiences I've had to date, outside of professional work experience.**

## Personal Projects
### Moby Dick
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/mobydick)

This was an exercise aimed to improve my Python skills and commit to an ETL/ELT project that involved the collection of data, data cleaning and a bit of visualisations.

### Australian Weather Analytics
[GitHub](https://github.com/equanimittyy/weatherau)

This was a personal project aimed to improve my familiarity with visualisation tools, more specifically PowerBI.
